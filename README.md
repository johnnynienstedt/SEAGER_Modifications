# SEAGER_Modifications
Making changes to Robert Orr's SEAGER metric for better interpretability and accuracy

Main changes:
- change from measurement in percentages to run value (more interpretable/quantifiable)
- change from digital to analog decision measuement, i.e. instead of just "bad" or "good", a continuous scale w/ magnitude

This project also includes documentation for a parallel project with one more modification:
- change from league-wide heatmaps for judging swing decisions to player personalized heatmaps, in an effort to measure which batters play to their strengths (or don't)
